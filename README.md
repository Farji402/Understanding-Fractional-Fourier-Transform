# Understanding-Fractional-Fourier-Transform
Numerical implementation of FrFT concepts for mini-project ph312

## About the Project
We established the concept of fractional Fourier transform representing
ordinary Fourier transform as a particular case of FrFT. We studied in detail
the various steps involved in the implementation of the fast fractional Fourier
transform. We showed the experimental results based on the implementation
of the fast fractional Fourier transform. Lastly, we obtained an expression for
a new type of convolution for fractional Fourier transform and verified the
theorems using graphical analysis. Two-dimensional implementation of
fractional convolution was also established and verified.
